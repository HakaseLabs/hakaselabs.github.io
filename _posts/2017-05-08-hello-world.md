Greetings earthlings. My name is Francis Sunday and some of you know me for different reasons depending on how we got to acquaint with each other. I am a Software Developer from Nigeria. Growing up, I was and still interested in technology.

I started out with designing my first webpage way back in *2014* - I didn't use a computer for that, I used a **Blackberry Touch 1** with the **MyWapBlog** platform (not in service again). It was awesome, I tweaked HTML, and CSS a bit (I didn't realy have a formal Developer education LOL ^..^).

I have improved over the years, though there is still a bunch of things to learn (it never ends), I try to stay up-to-date with the ever changing tech ecosystem by reading up articles by Awesome Developers out there, to Googling, Scrapping Stack Overflow.
> The most importand skillin life is the ability to Learn, Unlearn & Re-Learn

After forever years of procastination, I have decided to start this blog "HakaseLabs", where I'll be sharing my knowledge about Software Development. I'll be publishing articles to demistify various concepts and technologies.

I hope you'll enjoy my articles. Please leave a comment if you have any questions or comments.

Cheers!!
