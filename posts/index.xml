      <description>Summary: I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with JSON in various programming languages in context to data exchange/communication between applications. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll give a brief overview of the encoding/json package in Go, and point some gotchas I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered.

      <title>Enum Stringer Interface optimisation in Go</title>

      <guid>https://hakaselogs.me/2021-04-08/enum-stringer-interface-optimisation-in-go/</guid>
      <description>The most idiomatic way of describing an enum type in Go is to use constants, often in conjunction with iota.
A pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve used to implement the Stringer interface for an enum type is to lookup the string representation in a slice. Consider this snippet from a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on:
// Status ... type Status uint32 // List of possible status values const ( // The operation is known, but hasn&amp;#39;t been decided yet 	Processing Status = iota // The operation will never be accepted 	Rejected // The operation was accepted 	Accepted .</description>

      <description>Vim doesn&amp;rsquo;t show line numbers by default, they can be turned on in your vim configuration. Vim has an absolute, relative and hybrid line numbering mode. Absolute Line Numbers Addding the number option to your vim config, Vim sets up absolute line numbers to show the line number for each line in the current buffer. &amp;#34; set absolute numbersset number &amp;#34; orset nuRelative Line Numbers With the relativenumber option, each line in your file is numbered relative to the cursor‚Äôs current position.</description>

      <title>Building Small Containers for Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://hakaselogs.me/2018-12-01/building-small-containers-for-kubernetes/</link>

      <description>The first step to deploying any app to Kubernetes, is to bundle the app in a container. There are several official, and community-backed container images for various languages and distros, and most of these containers can be really large, or sometimes contain overheads your app may never need/use.
Thanks to Docker, you can easily create container images in a few steps; specify a base image, add your app-specific changes, and build your container.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how easy it is to build a web application with Go and the Gin framework and add authentication to it. Check out the Github repo for the code we&amp;rsquo;re going to write.
 Gin is a high-performance micro-framework that delivers a very minimalistic framework that carries with it only the most essential features, libraries, and functionalities needed to build web applications and microservices. It makes it simple to build a request handling pipeline from modular, reusable pieces.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll give an overview of the replicator database in CouchDB, how to spin off a replication task in CouchDB
 CouchDB is a database that completely embraces the web. CouchDB stores your data as JSON documents, and allows you access these documents easily, from a web interface or its REST API. We won&amp;rsquo;t be going too deep into couchdb as it would be out of scope for this article - I&amp;rsquo;ll write one of those pretty soon.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúGo will be the server language of the future.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTobias L√ºtke, Shopify
 Go was first created as an experiment, the goal of its creators was to come up with a language that would resolve bad practices of others while keeping the good things.
Its first release was on March 2012. Go was designed to feel familiar and to stay as simple as possible, the entire language specification fits in just a few pages.</description>

      <description>Getting into Software Development seem overwhelming (actually it is) these days. One has to go through the hassle of getting familiar with different languages, to organizing codebases, to libraries, frameworks, the list goes on. Every Job description (at least the sane ones), requires additional skills to get the job. Example of such, Version Control (Git or Mecurial), tasks runners, build tools, package managers, etc.
Most of these extra tools are being accessed/used from a command line interface.</description>

      <description>Go is a relatively new programming language, and nothing makes a developer go crazier than a new programming language, haha! As many new tech inventions, Go was created as an experiment. The goal of its creators was to come up with a language that would resolve bad practices of others while keeping the good things. It was first released in March 2012. Since then Go has attracted many developers from all fields and disciplines.</description>

      <description>Async and Await has been a blessing to most JavaScript Developers. Even while it was on the Stage 4 proposal for ES6, the feature has been warmtly welcomed.
Node.js now Supports async/await since its version 7.6.
What is async/await? If this is your first time seeing/hearing of this term, here&amp;rsquo;s it in plain English:
 Its the newest way/pattern of writing asychronous code in JavaScript, asides Promises and callbacks. Async/await compared to Promises, are non-blocking Async/await makes aysnchronous code appear and behave like synchronous code.</description>

      <description>The for..in and for..of loops, gives us a clean and concise syntax to iterate on iterable items like arrays, strings, objects, and enumerables. Now the question is where to use which. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little reminder to get you you started.
for..in Use this to iterate over the properties of an object:
let person = { name: &amp;#39;Francis&amp;#39;, alias: &amp;#39;codehakase&amp;#39;, eyeColour: &amp;#39;brown&amp;#39; }; for(let key in person) { console.log( `${key}=&amp;gt; ${person[key]}` ); } // name =&amp;gt; Francis // alias =&amp;gt; codehakase .</description>

      <description>Node.js is one intimidating JavaScript framework, especially for beginners. This article serves as a quick quide to Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. We&amp;rsquo;ll building a simple REST API that&amp;rsquo;ll serve as a basic foundation for an application.
For the purpose of this tutorial, you&amp;rsquo;ll be creating the base for a ToDo List application (yeah its kinda like the convention to start with ToDo list apps). You&amp;rsquo;ll use all CRUD (create, read, update and delete) actions on the API.</description>

This was my first attempt making twitter bots. I made a very simple twitter bot for this blog, check the Source and also follow @_hakasebot.
Setting Up The bot was created using the Twit package, which is a Twitter API client for Node.js. Twit needs to connect with my twitter account so first I created a new Twitter Application. After that, I took note of my application&amp;rsquo;s keys:</description>

      <description>In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like strings and arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages, and act as handy data containers.
What Is An Object? In JavaScript terms, An Object is a collection of data, which consits of several variables and functions - which are called properties and methods.</description>

      <guid>https://hakaselogs.me/2017-05-21/introduction-to-javascript-promises/</guid>
      <description>JavaScript promises have become a popular way to handle the tangled mess that JavaScript‚Äôs asynchronous nature often creates for us. Synchronous code is eaiser to follow and debug, async is better for flexibiity. Promises are becomming a big part of the JavaScript world, with awesome APIs implemented with it.
What is a Promise? A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action&amp;rsquo;s eventual success value or failure reason.</description>

      <description>For some PHP developers, the concept of object-orient programming, seems like a frightening concept. You might have browsed through repos on GitHub or read articles on how to implement a feature in a particular PHP project of yours, and the code is full of complicated syntax. I tell you, the concept of OOP is easy to grasp.
Object-Oriented programming (OOP), is a style of programming which allows us developers and programmers group related tasks or actions into classes to produce effective code.</description>
