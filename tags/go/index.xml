      <description>Summary: I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with JSON in various programming languages in context to data exchange/communication between applications. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll give a brief overview of the encoding/json package in Go, and point some gotchas I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered.
 Go to: Encoding | Decoding | HTTP Handler Example | Read and Write JSON to File | Streaming | Gotchas
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), is a popular data interchange format commonly used for communication between applications.</description>

      <title>Enum Stringer Interface optimisation in Go</title>

      <description>The most idiomatic way of describing an enum type in Go is to use constants, often in conjunction with iota.
A pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve used to implement the Stringer interface for an enum type is to lookup the string representation in a slice. Consider this snippet from a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on:
// Status ... type Status uint32 // List of possible status values const ( // The operation is known, but hasn&amp;#39;t been decided yet 	Processing Status = iota // The operation will never be accepted 	Rejected // The operation was accepted 	Accepted .</description>

      <description>The first step to deploying any app to Kubernetes, is to bundle the app in a container. There are several official, and community-backed container images for various languages and distros, and most of these containers can be really large, or sometimes contain overheads your app may never need/use.
Thanks to Docker, you can easily create container images in a few steps; specify a base image, add your app-specific changes, and build your container.</description>

      <title>Building a Web App With Go, Gin and React</title>
      <link>https://hakaselogs.me/2018-04-20/building-a-web-app-with-go-gin-and-react/</link>

      <description>TL;DR: In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how easy it is to build a web application with Go and the Gin framework and add authentication to it. Check out the Github repo for the code we&amp;rsquo;re going to write.
 Gin is a high-performance micro-framework that delivers a very minimalistic framework that carries with it only the most essential features, libraries, and functionalities needed to build web applications and microservices. It makes it simple to build a request handling pipeline from modular, reusable pieces.</description>

      <description>“Go will be the server language of the future.” — Tobias Lütke, Shopify
 Go was first created as an experiment, the goal of its creators was to come up with a language that would resolve bad practices of others while keeping the good things.
Its first release was on March 2012. Go was designed to feel familiar and to stay as simple as possible, the entire language specification fits in just a few pages.</description>

      <description>Go is a relatively new programming language, and nothing makes a developer go crazier than a new programming language, haha! As many new tech inventions, Go was created as an experiment. The goal of its creators was to come up with a language that would resolve bad practices of others while keeping the good things. It was first released in March 2012. Since then Go has attracted many developers from all fields and disciplines.</description>
