      <description>Getting into Software Development seem overwhelming (actually it is) these days. One has to go through the hassle of getting familiar with different languages, to organizing codebases, to libraries, frameworks, the list goes on.

Most of these extra tools are being accessed/used from a command line interface.</description>
